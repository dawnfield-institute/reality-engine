# Contributing to Reality Engine

## Current Status: Pre-Alpha - Not Accepting Contributions

Thank you for your interest in Reality Engine! However, this project is currently in **pre-alpha development** and **not accepting code contributions** at this time.

## Why Not Yet?

Reality Engine is still in the foundational research phase. The codebase, architecture, and theoretical framework are actively evolving. Accepting external contributions now would:

- Create maintenance burden while core features are still being established
- Risk diverging implementations before the foundation is stable
- Require significant time reviewing/integrating changes during critical development

## What You Can Do Instead

While we're not accepting code contributions yet, we **greatly value**:

### 📧 Feedback & Discussion
- Report bugs or unexpected behavior via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dawnfield-institute/reality-engine/issues)
- Share your observations from running simulations
- Ask questions about the framework or theory

### 🔬 Independent Research
- Run your own experiments with Reality Engine
- Validate (or challenge) the reported phenomena
- Publish your findings independently and share them
- Compare results with other physics frameworks

### 💡 Suggestions
- Propose ideas for analyzers or detection methods
- Suggest theoretical extensions or modifications
- Point out potential issues in the approach

### ⭐ Spread the Word
- Star the repository if you find it interesting
- Share with researchers who might benefit from it
- Cite it in your work if you use it

## How to Report Issues

If you encounter bugs, please open an issue with:
- Your environment (OS, Python version)
- Exact steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Any error messages or logs

## When Will Contributions Be Accepted?

We plan to open contributions once:
- The core architecture stabilizes (v1.0)
- Comprehensive test suite is in place
- Documentation is complete

This is tentatively planned for **Q2 2026**, but may change based on development progress.

## Stay Updated

Watch the repository for updates on when contribution guidelines will open.
