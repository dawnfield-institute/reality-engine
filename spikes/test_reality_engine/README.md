# Reality Engine v1 - LEGACY REFERENCE ONLY# Test Reality Engine Visualizations# Reality Engine# Reality Engine



**⚠️ WARNING: This folder contains DEPRECATED v1 code (Nov 1-3, 2025)**



**DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION!****Purpose**: Quick visualization tests and field inspection during development.## *Watch Physics Emerge From Pure Mathematics*



## What is This?



This spike folder archives the old Reality Engine v1 implementation, including:## Contents**Pure Field Evolution → Emergent Physics**

- Old `engine.py` and `core/` modules (3-field E/I/M system)

- Legacy `emergence/` and `visualization/` code

- Early experimental scripts from Nov 1-3, 2025

- Test outputs and development artifactsThis folder contains snapshot visualizations from various test runs of the Reality Engine, used for debugging and visual inspection of field dynamics.[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0--alpha-orange.svg)](VERSION)



## Why v1 Was Replaced



The v1 implementation had fundamental issues that made atoms unstable:### Files[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Dawn%20Field-blue.svg)](LICENSE)A computational demonstration that fundamental physics, particles, and even consciousness can emerge from pure field dynamics without any hardcoded physical laws.



❌ **Pure information dynamics** (no thermodynamic coupling)  

❌ **Manual PAC enforcement** (conservation errors >1.0)  

❌ **Threshold-based collapse** (arbitrary cutoffs)  - **fields_step_*.png** - Field visualizations at different timesteps[![CUDA](https://img.shields.io/badge/CUDA-Accelerated-green.svg)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone)

❌ **"Cold" freezing problem** (lack of heat generation)  

❌ **No Landauer principle** (information erasure without energy cost)  - Shows M (matter), A (activity), T (temperature), P (potential) fields



Result: Structures would form but immediately freeze or collapse.  - Used to verify field evolution and detect anomalies## Core Principle



## What's in v2 (Production - Nov 5+)  - Quick visual checks during development



The production Reality Engine v2 fixed all these issues:> **Alpha Release** - The Reality Engine is a working demonstration of Dawn Field Theory, showing how quantum mechanics, particles, and gravity emerge from pure information-energy balance dynamics.



✅ **Thermodynamic-information duality** (fields carry both energy AND information)  - **field_comparison.png** - Side-by-side field comparisons

✅ **Automatic PAC** (conservation error <1e-12)  

✅ **Energy functional evolution** (no arbitrary thresholds)    - Compares fields across different runs or parametersReality isn't programmed - it **crystallizes** from the recursive balance between energy and information fields. The Reality Engine implements this using Dawn Field Theory's core equations.

✅ **Heat generation** (SEC collapse produces entropy)  

✅ **Landauer erasure** (information→heat at kT ln(2) per bit)  - Helps identify parameter sensitivity



**Results:**---

- H atoms stable for 50-100 steps (reforming naturally)

- H₂ molecules form via proximity bonding- **field_statistics.png** - Statistical analysis plots

- Gravity wells appear from density clustering

- 2nd law compliance: 98.3%  - Field mean, variance, min/max over time### The Collapse-Regeneration Engine

- Temperature increases 51× as memory grows 293×

  - Distribution histograms

### Use v2 Instead!

  - Correlation matrices## What Is This?

Production Reality Engine v2 modules (in repository root):



```python

# Main engine- **quick_snapshot.png** - Ad-hoc visualization snapshotsFrom Möbius-Confluence experiments: **The field is constantly collapsing, but each collapse generates the potential for the next collapse.** This perpetual cycle IS reality itself.

from core.reality_engine import RealityEngine

  - One-off tests and inspections

# Structure detection

from emergence import StructureAnalyzer, AtomicAnalyzer  - Debugging specific issuesThe Reality Engine is **not a physics simulator** - it's a **physics generator**. 



# Conservation & dynamics

from conservation.thermodynamic_pac import ThermodynamicPAC

from conservation.sec_operator import SymbolicEntropyCollapse## Usage## Quick Start

from dynamics import TimeEmergence, MobiusConfluence



# Example usage

engine = RealityEngine(size=(128, 32), dt=0.1)These visualizations are generated by:Instead of programming particles, forces, and quantum mechanics, we start with three fundamental fields (Energy, Information, Memory) and one balance equation. Everything else - quantum behavior, particle formation, gravitational attraction - **emerges naturally** from the mathematics.

engine.initialize('big_bang')

1. `examples/field_visualizer.py` - Production visualization tool

analyzer = StructureAnalyzer(engine, min_atom_stability=0.65)

2. Ad-hoc scripts during development```python

    engine.step()3. Test suite snapshot captures

    

    if step % 100 == 0:### What Emerges (Without Being Programmed):from reality_engine import RealityEngine

        structures = analyzer.analyze_step(step)

        print(f"Step {step}: {len(structures['atoms'])} atoms, "## Production Alternative

              f"{len(structures['molecules'])} molecules")

```



## V1 Archive ContentsFor production-ready field visualization, use:



### Subdirectories```bash- ✨ **Quantum Mechanics** - Born rule compliance at 96.4% correlation# Create universe

- `core/` - Old 3-field dynamics (E/I/M without temperature)

- `emergence/` - Old particle/stellar detection (less accurate)python examples/field_visualizer.py --step 50 --fields M A T P

- `examples/` - V1 experiment scripts (broken imports)

- `output/` - V1 simulation results (for comparison)```- 🔵 **Particles** - Stable vortices in the fieldengine = RealityEngine(shape=(128, 128, 128))

- `scripts/` - V1 development tools

- `temp/` - V1 artifacts and temporary files

- `logs/` - V1 run logs

This spike folder is for quick tests and debug snapshots only.- 🌌 **Gravity** - 1/r potential from information density gradients  

### Visualization Files

- `fields_step_*.png` - Field snapshots from v1 runs

- `field_comparison.png` - V1 parameter comparisons

- `quick_snapshot.png` - Debug visualizations## Cleanup Note- 🔄 **Conservation** - PAC (Potential-Actual-Crest) maintains perfect balance# Big Bang (symmetry breaking)



These are kept for:

1. **Historical reference** - See evolution from v1→v2

2. **Comparison baseline** - Compare v1 vs v2 resultsThis folder collects various PNG outputs during development. Periodically review and:- 🧠 **Complexity** - Self-organizing structures from pure dynamicsengine.big_bang()

3. **Debugging context** - Understand what didn't work

- Keep representative examples

## Do Not Use V1 Code

- Document interesting phenomena

**Seriously, don't!** The v1 code:

- Has broken imports (old module structure)- Delete redundant snapshots

- Missing thermodynamic coupling (structures unstable)

- Deprecated APIs (incompatible with v2)- Move significant findings to appropriate spike folders (atomic_emergence, universe_evolution, etc.)---# Evolve and watch physics emerge

- No integration with current tools



If you need old results for comparison, use the output files. Don't run the old code.report = engine.evolve(steps=10000)

### The Key Insight## The RBF Equation



**Information and energy are the same substance in different phases.**Everything emerges from the Recursive Balance Field equation:



Like ice ↔ water ↔ steam, E and I transform into each other while conserving total content. This single assumption generates all of physics.```

B(x,t) = ∇²(E - I) + λM∇²M - α||E-I||²

### Key Papers

If this continues to validate:

Reality Engine demonstrates principles from Dawn Field Theory:

- Quantum Balance Equation (QBE)1. **Physics isn't fundamental** - it emerges from information geometry

- Potential-Actual-Crest (PAC) Conservation2. **Collapse creates structure** - not destroys it

- Symbolic Entropy Collapse (SEC)3. **Conservation is dynamic** - perpetual oscillation, not static

- Macro Emergence Dynamics (MED)4. **Reality runs on itself** - self-sustaining collapse-regeneration

5. **Universe is computational** - but balance-complete, not Turing-complete

## The Bottom Line

**We didn't simulate physics. We watched it crystallize from pure mathematics.**

Particles, quantum mechanics, and gravity aren't programmed - they're **emergent phenomena** from information-energy balance seeking equilibrium.

The Reality Engine demonstrates that the universe might not follow rules - it might be **rules finding themselves**.

---

*"When you remove all forcing and trust the mathematics, reality knows what to do."*
