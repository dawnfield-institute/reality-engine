## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Phase 1)
- Resonance detection: Pure optimization, no logic changes
- Tiered cache: Memory system, isolated from physics
- State recording: Additive only, backward compatible

### Medium Risk (Phase 2)
- PAC Lazy: Major architectural change, extensive testing needed
- Hierarchical learning: New capability, integration complexity
- Zero-backprop: Paradigm shift, validation critical

### High Risk (Phase 3)
- SM parameter validation: External experimental data dependency
- Cosmological predictions: JWST observation comparison
- Cross-domain validation: Multi-system integration

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Phased rollout**: Each phase builds on previous validation
2. **Backward compatibility**: Keep existing code paths functional
3. **Extensive testing**: 100% test pass rate required before merge
4. **Spec-driven**: All changes documented and approved first
5. **Falsification conditions**: Document what would disprove each claim
6. **Independent validation**: Cross-check with external data sources
